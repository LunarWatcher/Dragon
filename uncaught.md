Like I said I'm new so I'm quite lost here.

**I'm new on Angular and** I'm trying to get all data of one table and do an Excel of it.

- It would be great to hear your opinion on this and, once again, advanced apologies if it turns out to be a mistake on my side.

New to coding sorry if the question not explained well.

Here is my two cents. 

I hope I made a lot clear for you guys. 

Any suggestions pls?

PS: I'm not English speaker so sorry if I made some English mistake.

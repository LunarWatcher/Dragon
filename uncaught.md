Like I said I'm new so I'm quite lost here.

As you would have known I am quite new to this.  Please let me know if additional inputs are needed from my side.

Please bear with my first ever question on Stack Overflow.

It would be great to hear your opinion on this and, once again, advanced apologies if it turns out to be a mistake on my side.

New to coding sorry if the question not explained well.

Here is my two cents. 

I hope I made a lot clear for you guys. 

Any suggestions pls?

PS: I'm not English speaker so sorry if I made some English mistake.

I hope someone can help and I thank you in advance for any help! 

What have I done wrong here and should there be a better way of doing this. **Any suggestions are greatly appreciated**

I hope you fixed your issue already, but if you haven't, I hope this works for you..

I have no idea to fix this and I hope that someone who has more knowledge about this can help me...

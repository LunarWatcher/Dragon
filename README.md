# Dragon

2k tool meant to automate editing on Stack Overflow, because there's too much crap to do it all manually.

**Disclaimer:** There's going to be false positives. All use of this tool is at your own risk.

## Requirements
* Python 3 (because there's few languages with good )
* Various dependencies: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
* 2k+ reputation on Stack Overflow (this tool is NOT going to be designed for &lt;2k users to avoid flooding the review queues, and to not have to deal with )

## OAuth

Because Dragon requires write access, it has to use the client-side OAuth flow.

        <h1>Token echo</h1>
        <p>For obvious reasons, keep your token secret. (This page is purely an echo page, and doesn't store any information about the token, unless GitHub silently records this data from web requests or something). Copy it or it'll be lost. Your token is:</p>
        <p id="token">Token not received yet... :(</p>
        <p>Also note that there's been an attempt to copy() the token from JavaScript</p>

            copy(document.getElementById("token").innerHTML);

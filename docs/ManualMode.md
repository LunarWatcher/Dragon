# Manual mode

Manual mode is a way to approve/deny edits, as well as applying custom filters.<sup>not implemented at the time of writing</sup>

This mode allows a number of responses that do different things:

| Response | Action | Edit? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| y, yes, 1, true | Allows the edit | yes |
| o | Opens the post, re-prompts for further action | no |
| ye | Short for "yes, [and] edit" - confirms the automatic edit, and opens the edit link in your browser | Yes |
| ne | Short for "no, edit" - skips the automatic edit, but still opens the edit link in your browser | No |
| n, no | Disallows the edit | No |
